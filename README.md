## Skills

#### Time Management & Communication
As an Assistant Regional Youth Leader I lead a team of 50+ people to hold successful events and exhibitions, it has greatly enhanced my leadership and team-working skills. As part of my role I oversee the local activities organised by the local youth leaders, as a result of this I have vastly improved my communication skills. Time management is key to all successful event making sure everything runs as planned.

#### Adaptability
Adaptability is one of the most important skills that I have learned and improved over the years. It has played a very crucial part in every role that I have worked in, whether it was adapting and customising my approach to every customer while working at EE as a sales advisor or dealing with unexpected circumstances whilst organising charity events for AMYA UK.

#### Problem Solving
As a software developer my day to day job is to find solutions for problems in the shortest time possible. Being able to look at a problem and break it down into steps is crucial. Studying at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy/) has greatly improved my problem solving skill, debugging to get visibility of my code and from there form potential solutions for the problem at hand.
